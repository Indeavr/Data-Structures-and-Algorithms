# Heights

Your task is to find the heights of a triangle. The triangle is given by 3 sets of coordinates in 2D space - the coordinates of each of the triangle's verteces.

## Input
- Input is read from the console
  - Input is consisted of 3 lines, each containing two numbers
    - `x` and `y` for each of the triangle's verteces

## Output
- Output should be printed on the console
  - Output is consisted of 3 lines
    - print each height on a separate line
    - use **two** decimal digits of precision
	- look at the sample tests for the order of the heights

## Constraints
- Coordinates will be in the range `[-1000; 1000]`
- Coordinates will be integer numbers
- **Time limit**: **0.1s**
- **Memory limit**: **16 MB**
